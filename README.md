# Plant_Monitor

Most beginner embedded projects use simple sensor thresholds with basic if/else logic. 

This project combines lookup tables for plant-specific parameters with binary search algorithms for historical pattern matching and adaptive learning.

# Requirements
Plant Profile Management: Define struct-based lookup table accessible via direct array indexing.

Smart Sensor Classification: Implement binary search through sorted threshold arrays to efficiently categorize continuous moisture/light/temperature readings into discrete levels.

Historical Pattern Learning: Store timestamped sensor data in sorted arrays and use binary search to find similar past conditions for predictive decision making.

# Project Overview
This project is a smart plant monitoring system that classifies sensor readings using threshold profiles for different plant types. 
It uses structured data and implements binary search to enable adaptive decision-making based on historical data patterns.

# ðŸ”§ Features
Bullet-point style:

Struct-based plant profile management

Simulated sensor classification for moisture, light, and temperature

Custom UART communication using AVR registers

Categorizes readings into states: Too Low / Optimal / Too High

[Upcoming] Binary search classification

[Upcoming] Historical pattern matching with stored sensor data
