# Step 01 â€“ UART, Button & LED (Bare Metal AVR C)

âœ… Low-level UART setup (no Arduino Serial library)  
âœ… Direct port manipulation using `DDRB`, `PORTB`, `PIND`, etc.  
âœ… Button input with internal pull-up resistor  
âœ… Software debounce using `_delay_ms()`  
âœ… LED toggles ON/OFF with button press  
âœ… UART message prints: "LED ON"

This is the first step in building my **Smart Plant Monitor with Adaptive Learning** project. Each folder in this repo represents a milestone in my learning journey.

## Code Summary

- `main.c`: Contains the full C code for button detection and UART feedback using ATmega328p.

ðŸ”œ **Next Step**: Interfacing with sensors, using structs for plant profiles, and categorizing simulated sensor readings.
