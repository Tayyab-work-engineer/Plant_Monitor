This version adds:

- UART-based serial output using a custom `print_ln()` function
- A `PlantProfile` struct to define moisture, light, and temperature thresholds
- Classification of simulated readings
- Button-triggered logic to classify and print sensor data
- LED indicator when the button is pressed

This is a milestone towards integrating real sensors and machine learning for adaptive behavior.
